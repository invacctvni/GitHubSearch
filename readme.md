Speer Technologies React Native assessment
Overview
The goal of this assessment is to build a basic React Native application which demonstrates common tasks such as fetching data, parsing model entities from JSON, UI, and navigation.

Requirements
For this asessment you'll need to familiarize yourself with parts of the GitHub REST API. The required features we'd like to see built are:

A search bar that enables us to fetch GitHub user profiles by username:
If no user exists with the username provided, present a "Not found" view
If the user exists, present a view with that user's:
Avatar
Username
Name
Description
Follower count, i.e. X followers
Following count, i.e. X following
A view which displays a list of the user's followers, as well as a view for who they're following
We should be able to navigate to this view by tapping on the follower/following counts
If a user in this list is tapped, it should navigate us to their profile view
The ability to navigate backwards through the navigation stack
Show us what you can do in no more than 24 hours. Keep a log of the time spent and include it with your submission.

Note that there are no designs to follow for this assessment, so you have creative freedom when it comes to the layout and so on. If you are on Macbook, you should build the application for both iOS and Android. If you have windows, just Android build is fine.

Bonus features
These features aren't mandatory, but if you have extra time and want to stand out feel free to add any of the following:

Skeleton screens
Pull to refresh
Profile caching & cache invalidation
Grading
This exercise will be graded on a number of criteria including, but not limited to:

Clean, readable, and well documented code
Adherence to the SOLID principles
Utilization of an architectural pattern
Reusable components
Submission
There is no specific deadline, but please keep your work within a 24 hour time period (meaning you can start whenever as long you complete the assessment within a 24 hour period). It would be great if you could submit the assessment as soon as possible.

Please commit all of your work to a private GitHub repository. When you are finished, include a log of the time spent for this assessment, invite the tae-at-speer account.
